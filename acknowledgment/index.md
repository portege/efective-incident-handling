# Overview
The first step of incident handling is the acknowledgement or getting notified once the incident's happens. Ideally, sooner is better, But in real case scenario, the first witnesses is not always a system or person in the team or organization it self. The reporter can be from anywhere, external team or external organization. And we need to setup a proper environment so that we can cover all the use-cases.

# Prerequisite
## SLO
We need to define the SLO of each our components that we owned or maintained, and we will use this SLO as a benchmark or a threshold of the alerting system. Please remember, there are two main category to define an SLO -- that is a Service and Pipeline, which have different characteristic and different goal for SLO.
